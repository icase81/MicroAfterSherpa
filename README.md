I had a printed Sherpa Micro sitting on my desk complete with motor, but as disappointed after the fact to find that the mounting pattern isn't the same as the Sherpa Mini.
Seeing the <a href="https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa">MiniAfterSherpa</a> had CAD files, I tried my hand at modifying it to fit the Micro. This is the result.

I've only tried with a Dargonfly, as I don't have a Dragon to test, but I presume it'll work fine with the Dragon. The mounting holes for both are present.
